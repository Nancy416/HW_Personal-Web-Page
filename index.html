<B>Welcome to my page!</b>
<br> I am a muralist with a graphic design background that enjoys visiting galleries, museums, dining out, and having the occassional cocktail at a reasonable time so that I can be home, in bed no later than midnight. I also enjoy a good hike and bike rides whenever I can get out of the city.</br>

  <BR>My skills include the following:</BR>
  <ul>
    <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
    <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
    <li>Adobe InDesign</li>
    <li>Procreate</li>
    <li>Acrylic Painting</li>
    <li>Lettering</li>
  </ul>

<br>Today I learned the coding fundamentals of <i><U>TAGS</U></i> and making Rows and columns in html.</br>

  <br>What I would like out of this course is to provide me with a solid foundation so that I may continue my education in coding.</br>
